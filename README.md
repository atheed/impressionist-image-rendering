# Impressionist Image Rendering
Uses Canny edge detection to produce impressionist/painterly renderings of images

## Results
Below are two images (both the originals, and the final impressionist renderings) that were used to test the renderer. They are provided here just to showcase a couple of sample results:

### Original Images
